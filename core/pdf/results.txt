- **CSRF Tokens:** Each sensitive request includes a unique token that is validated on the server side, ensuring authenticity and preventing unauthorized actions.
- **SameSite Cookie Attribute:** Cookies are set with the SameSite attribute to `Strict` or `Lax`, which restricts the inclusion of cookies in cross-site requests.
- **Referer Header Validation:** Requests are validated to ensure they originate from trusted sources, further mitigating the risk of CSRF attacks.

### Recommendations

Although no vulnerabilities were found, maintaining a proactive approach to security is crucial. Here are some best practices:

- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security assessments to ensure no new vulnerabilities are introduced.
- **User Education:** Inform users about safe browsing practices and the importance of not clicking on suspicious links.
- **Stay Updated:** Keep security measures up-to-date with the latest industry standards and recommendations.

### Conclusion

The website ['https://discord.com'] demonstrates a strong security posture against CSRF vulnerabilities. By continuing to implement and update robust security measures, the website can maintain its protection against potential CSRF attacks.
